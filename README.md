# Chirp Sounder 2

This is a work in progress to create a new version of the GNU Chirp Sounder, which can operate without a GPSDO. The software consists of two components:

1) Detect chirps
2) Analyze chirps

At the moment, the first part has been implemented. The second part has already been implemented using GNU Chirp Sounder, but remains to be ported to this code base.
